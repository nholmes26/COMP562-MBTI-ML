# COMP562-MBTI-ML
# Predicting Personality Type Using Multiple Classifier Models
`COMP 562 Fall 2023 Final Project`

For our COMP562 final project, we are comparing the accuracy of four models at predicting Myers-Briggs personality types based on the tweets a person has made. The models we implemented were: <br /> 
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) <br />
- Logistic Regression <br />
- Multinomial Naive Bayes <br />
- Random Forests <br />

## Abstract

This study explores machine learning's application to analyze social media, specifically Tweets, for precise Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality identification. Using four diverse machine learning models, we evaluate and compare their efficacy in understanding the nuanced relationship between social media language use and personality traits, offering practical implications for both machine learning and social sciences.

Keywords: MBTI Personality, Social Media, Machine Learning
