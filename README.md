## Abstract

Classification stands as a pioneering domain in the realm of machine learning research, permeating our daily lives through sophisticated data processing models. From discerning spam emails to categorizing patient diagnoses, we are constantly immersed in the practical applications of these advanced technologies. This project delves into the realm of social media, leveraging a diverse dataset of Tweets that encapsulate both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. Within this paper, we undertake the construction and evaluation of accuracy in identifying personality types based on users' tweet content. Our approach involves employing logistic regression, random forest classifier, and KNN classifier models to discern nuanced patterns and trends.
