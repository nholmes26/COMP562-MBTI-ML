Abstract:
    This study explores machine learning's application to analyze social media, specifically Tweets, for precise Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality identification. Using four diverse machine learning models, we evaluate and compare their efficacy in understanding the nuanced relationship between social media language use and personality traits, offering practical implications for both machine learning and social sciences.
